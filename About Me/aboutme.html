              <p>
                My name is NyShaun Greene, I graduated <i>Cum Laude</i> from the
                University of Maryland Eastern Shore with a Bachelor's in
                Electrical/Electronic Engineering Technology in May of 2021.
                <br />
                I am currently in search of entry level positioins such as: Jr.
                ServiceNow Developer, Jr. Full-Stack Developer, or Jr. Software
                Engineer to complete my career transition into the tech
                industry. I am currently ServiceNow CSA certified (with the
                Tokyo Delta exam completed) and I am a certified ScrumMaster. I
                am eager, excited, and ready to get started with my new journey.
